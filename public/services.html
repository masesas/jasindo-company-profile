                <p>A sense of security is one of the very important human needs, especially in the midst of high crime
                    rates.</p>
                <p>The Bodyguard or Personal Escort is a Special Security Unit owned by PT. Jasa Security Indoservis.
                    The Bodyguard personnel we provide are personnel who have martial arts skills, rescue knowledge both
                    for clients, themselves and others, have high alertness and strong instincts so they are able to
                    recognize situations that are potentially dangerous and threaten the client's safety.</p>
                <p>Before carrying out escort duties, Bodyguards must know who and what is being escorted. Where, with
                    what to escort, why it must be escorted, how to deal with problems that occur to the client. Because
                    the clients faced are very diverse and have different characters. The approach is certainly
                    different again.</p>
